<h1>Transgender Rights and Feminism</h1>
<p> Trans people have faced oppression for years, and with a quick search, various examples will come up of violence they face and bills written to discriminate against them. Three out of five trans Americans faced discrimination as of 2020. Trans women are at an interesection of the opppression trans people face and women face. This is seen in ways such as assualt, "not being woman enough" for gendered spaces, discrimination when trying to find jobs, etc. </p>
<p>Within the feminist community there is disagreement over trans rights. Some feminists believe that it will make it more difficult to solve sex based oppression. On the more extreme end, some others call themselves Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERF), and label trans women as dangerous. A big argument they make is that transwomen will make women's restrooms dangerous. An interestings fact is that more US Congressmen have been convicted of assaulting someone in a bathroom than trans people.</p>
