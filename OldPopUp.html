<h1>Ageism and Feminism</h1>
<p>There are three parts to this. The first is preventative actions taken to not be seen as old. Most women use countless products or procedures to hide signs of aging. In society, a majority of women's "value" decreases with age while a majority of men's increases. This is seen with descriptor's like "aged like fine wine" to decribe male actors. On the contrast, most female actors are torn apart in the media when signs of aging show up. </p>
<p>While older workers in general are more likely to be let go, women face higher layoff and unempolyment rates. Combined with women's lower wages compared to men, this easily becomes a problem, impacting all aspects of life, not being able to afford bills, etc. This stems back to women's "value" decreasing with age. Intelligent and capable women are no longer considered so for their jobs, while ageing male professors conrinue to work into their 70's. Studies have shown women are more adept investors, managers, and entrepreneurs. If companies hired and/or retained ageing women, they could benefit from the better communication and technical skills, the experience of older individuals to complement younger employees' strengths and saving money due to less trainings.</p>
<p>The third is society's view. This includes discrimination in healthcare, elder abuse, assault, and quite commonly, familial neglect. </p>
