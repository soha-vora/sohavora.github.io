<h1>The Feminist Five</h1>
	<p>The Feminist Five are Li Maizi, Wang Man, Wei Tingting, Wu Rongrong and Zheng Churan.</p>
<p>Li Maizi is known for demanding more public toilets for women and for heading the LGBT program at the Beijing Yienping Center, which promotes social justice and public health for Hep B, HIV, and disabled people.
<br>Wu Rongrong is the founder and executive director of the Weizhiming Women’s center in Hangzhou. She has helped AIDS victims by working at The Aizhixing Institute in Beijing, and led women’s rights programs at the Beijing Yirenping Center.
<br>Wang Man is a human rights and feminist activist. She is also a gender researcher.  
<br>Wei TingTing is a Chinese feminist and activist for gay rights and women’s rights. She is also the director of Jiande, an unregistered LGBT rights group in Beijing; she helped set up the group in Wuhan as well. She is also a core member of annual AIDS Walk on the Great Wall.
<br>Zheng Churan has campaigned against gender discrimination and has tried to speak with officials of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>On March 7 2015, they were arrested for demonstrating against sexual assault. Their plan was to hand out stickers in different cities for International Women's Day, but they were arrested in advance, held for 37 days, and released due to enormous public backlash. China is currently not a safe space for activists to speak up, as seen with the #MeToo activist Sophia Huang Xueqin who was arrested as well. Because of this, some activists have moved abroad. While the stereotypical women's role as caregivers for elders and children remains, they are expected to study, pursue a career, work, and balance their expected marriages. These expectations pile on top of women still facing loss of autonomy with policies like the one-child policy, gender discrimination and abuse at home, on the streets, online and in the workplace. It's clear why feminists are fighting back.</p>
