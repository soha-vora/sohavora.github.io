<h1>Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Over the past few years, so many feminists have rebelled against motherhood in response to the forced gender roles, including questions like "When will you settle down and have kids?" and comments like "Women belong at home." However, while, this is important, something many forget is women who actually want to have children and stay home to raise them. According to the US Census Bureau, in 2018, two-thirds of the working women with children under 18 worked full-time in 2018. As mentioned, while many of them are pursuing their careers, it can be safely assumed that some returned to their jobs out of a need. In the US, mothers get 12 weeks of unpaid leave if they work for a company of 50+ employees. Below is a table showing different countries maternity leave laws to compare to the US. Mothers can get financially penalized for taking time off. The lack of support and resources mothers have disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Great examples of this is the poor sex education in schools.</p>
