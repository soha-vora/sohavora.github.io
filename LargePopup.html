	<h1>Fatphobia and Feminism</h1>
	<p>It has been scientifically shown that most of the way your body looks is genetic. There are two ways fatphobia becomes a feminist issue. 
		<br>The first is women being accepting of other women's bodies, not shaming them, and creating healthy mindsets for themselves. This is seen within the body acceptance movement that has been on the rise lately. Although there are some flaws in the movement, the movement rejects the idea that anyone should be discriminate against or shamed for their body.</p>
	<p>One well known leader of the body acceptance movement is Lizzo.

	<p>The second is society's view. The fatphobia many women face translates into their love life, issues finding jobs, assaults, eating disorders, not finding suitable clothes and their voices not being heard. One of the biggest points is their problems not beiing taken seriously and voices not heard. Below is the experience of a woman facing fatphobia, and one of the things she talks about is her eating disorder not being taken seriously.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
