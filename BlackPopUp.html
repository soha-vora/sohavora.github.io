<h1>Black Feminism and Intersectionality</h1>
<p>Kimberlé Crenshaw
<br>She coined the term “intersectionality” in her insightful 1989 essay, “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics.” She argues that black women are discriminated in a way that does not fall under racism or sexism, but both together. The term has expanded to include the interlocking of oppressions in general. </p>
<p>Alice Walker coined the term "Womanist" to describe the Black Feminist Movement. Womanist is usually referring to outrageous, audacious, courageous or willful behavior. Someone wanting to know more and in greater depth than is considered "good" for them. Someone responsible, in charge, and serious. Also, they are a woman who loves other women, sexually and/or nonsexually. They appreciate and prefer women's culture, women's emotional flexibility, women's willingness to value tears as a natural counterbalance to laughter, and women's strength. They are committed to the survival and wholeness of entire people, male and female. They are not separatist, except periodically, for health.</p>
<p>Patricia Hill wrote in her 1990 publication about the contradictions Black women face. She questioned if women are considered passive and fragile, why are black women given heavy work like cleaning? Or if the best thing a woman can become by society's standards is a mother, than why are black women constantly pressured to use birth control? Along the same lines, why are there not the same resources for them as mothers?</p>
<p>Particular issues the Black Feminism Movement has focused on are reproductive rights, sterilization abuse, equal access to abortion, health care, child care, the rights of the disabled, violence against women, rape, battering, sexual harassment, welfare rights, lesbian and gay rights, aging, police brutality, labor organizing, anti-imperialist struggles, anti-racist organizing, nuclear disarmament, and preserving the environment. </p>
