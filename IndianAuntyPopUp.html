<h1>Feminism in India</h1>
	<p>These are six Indian feminist that dedicated their lives to advancing feminism. Much of their work focuses on education and women’s safety, which are a key issue in India. Other issues not discussed here, but are more current, are reducing the stigma around menstrual products and increasing availability, as well as colorism.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Savitribai Phule (1831-1897)
She was the country’s first female teacher who set up 17+ schools for women of all castes. She also campaigned against female infanticide, widows and pregnant rape victims.

<br>Fatima Sheikh (around the same time of Phule)
She was a colleague of Phule and the first Muslim woman teacher in India.<br></p>

<p>Phule and Sheikh both chose to leave their house over stopping their work when given an ultimatum, and stayed with Sheikh’s siblings. They opened a school together here and taught to women from marginalized communities. This was risky given the norms of Phule’s caste and Sheikh’s Muslim community. </p>

<p>Tarabai Shinde (1850-1910)
She, also, is an associate of Phule and is regarded as one of India’s first modern feminists. Her first published work explores the disparities between women and men. She believed that women around the world were similarly oppressed.</p>

<p>Ramabai Ranade (1863-1924)
She dedicated her life to making women self-reliant and financially independent. She is the founder of Seva Sadan, an institution that trained thousands of women in various skills in Mumbai and Pune. Although she was allowed to complete her studies later, she was not allowed to study as a child and was married off at 11 years old. This influenced her work greatly.</p>

<p>Dr. Vina Mazumdar (1927-2013)
She was one of the first women to be involved in both Women’s studies and Women’s activism. In 1982, she became a founding member for the Indian Association of Women’s Studies, which conducts national conferences to promotes Women’s studies to this day.</p>

<p>Sharmila Rege (1964-2013)
Her work is known for criticizing the masculinization of Dalithood and Savarnisation of womanhood. This leads to the exclusion of Dalit womanhood overall. She amplified ideologies in the feminist movement focusing on the voices of the marginalized and oppressed.</p>
