<h1>White Feminism</h1>
<p>White feminism goes all the way back to the suffragettes. The first wave of feminsim, the women's rights movement, was a movement that was started by maninly white women for white women. While there were leaders, like Susan B. Anthony, who were POC, their goal was to further the rights of white women, which led to the 19th Amendment. The 19th Amendment was hailed as granting all women the right to vote, but in reality, only white women earned the right to vote. Racism kept black women from voting, and Natives weren't even recognized as citizens until later, to name a few groups. </p>
<p>The second wave focused on equal pay, educational equality, and greater control of their reproductive health care. However, while white women were focusing on access and availabiltiy to birth control and abortions, black women wanted to stop the genocide actively being committed against disabled women and them, due to forced sterilization. Both sets of issues are important, but white women wanted to complete their autonomy, while black women were fighting for some level of autonomy at all. </p>
<p>The third and fourth waves' lines are a bit blurry but intersectionality are pretty key, and in the fourth wave social media plays a big role.</p>
	
<p>So what's the point of all this? White feminists are often unaware of and unwilling to admit their privilege within the feminist movement. Also, many are critical of cultures and identities they don't understand, a common example being the hijab being viewed as a symbol of oppression.</p>
