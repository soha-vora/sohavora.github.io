<h1>Queer Feminism</h1>
<p>The LGBTQ+ community faces discrimination on a daily basis. As of a 2020 survey, 1 in 3 LGBTQ Americans faced discrimination of some kind in the past year. This discrimination is bound to affect mental health. It also affects physical health, with 3 in 10 LGBTQ Americans reporting difficulties in the last year accessing necessary medical care due to cost issues, and 15% of LGBTQ Americans reporting postponing or avoiding medical treatment due to discrimination. These numbers are nearly double for transgender people. Lastly, more than half of LGBTQ Americans reported hiding a personal relationship to avoid discrimination. Feminists should be fighting against the discrimination of other women. </p>
<p>Women have shared experiences with LGBTQ+ community of discrimination in healthcare, jobs and wages, assualt, and gender sterotyping. Having a lower income in the household due to the fact both earners are women, added with queer discrimination, is definitely a feminist issue. Gender stereotyping is a major point feminists have fought against. However, in society, lesbians are stereotyped as having short hair, dressing masculine, and not being feminine enough to be a "real woman." Not to mention the issue of lesbian fetishization. Bisexual women are viewed as confused or in a phase. They also get fetishized the same way lesbians do. These are just a couple of examples.</p>
